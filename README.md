# Global Developer Trends: Exploring Current and Future Technology Preferences

A data analysis project examining global developer technology preferences using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey to identify current usage patterns and emerging trends in programming languages and databases. This is my capstone project for the IBM Data Analyst Profesisonal Certificate. 

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset to compare the technologies developers use today with those they want to use in the near future. The insights help data professionals, hiring managers, and educators align their skills and strategies with global technology trends.

**Key Questions Explored:**
- Which programming languages and databases are most widely used today?
- What technologies are developers most interested in learning next year?
- How can professionals position themselves for future opportunities?

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Programming Languages
- **Python and JavaScript** dominate current usage and remain the most desired for next year
- **Emerging interest**: TypeScript, Go, and Rust show strong growth despite lower current usage
- **Stable demand**: Java and C maintain steady interest in enterprise and legacy systems

### Databases
- **SQL databases** (particularly PostgreSQL) remain dominant in current usage and future interest
- **Rising stars**: NoSQL and cloud databases like MongoDB and Redis show higher projected growth
- **Traditional stability**: MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server maintain consistent usage with slower growth

### Implications and Recommendations for Data Professionals
- Prioritize learning Python, while embracing continuous learning of modern languages (TypeScript, Go) to stay relevant in the job market.
- Develop skills in both relational (SQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL/cloud databases


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- **SQL** - Data querying and transformation
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
- **Google Looker Studio** - Dashboard creation and visualization

## 📈 Methodology & Skills

**Data Source**: Stack Overflow Developer Survey (public dataset on Kaggle)

**Data Cleaning Process**:
- Appropriately handled duplicates and null values
- Standardized numeric and categorical columns
- Split multi-response fields for granular analysis
- Created derived variables (Region, EmploymentCategory) for enhanced insights

**Analysis Approach**:
- Comparative analysis of current usage vs. future interest
- Statistical Prescriptive Analysis of Developer's preferences
- Trend identification across programming languages and databases
- Demographic profiling of survey respondents

**Key Skills**:

This project demonstrates:
- **Data wrangling expertise** with messy, real-world survey data
- **SQL and Python proficiency** for end-to-end data analysis
- **Business insight generation** from technical data patterns
- **Data visualization skills** to communicate findings effectively
- **Strategic thinking** connecting technical trends to professional development
